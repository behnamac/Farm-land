This project serves as a simple example to understand the typical workings of an IDLE project.
Upon cloning, you'll discover a field and a money-based economy.
Spend your money to unlock the field and initiate agriculture. 
Additionally, you can purchase AI assistance, which automates the agriculture process,
generating income for you. This mechanism is common in hybrid casual and IDLE games. 
unlike my other GitHub uploads, I've opted for JSON instead of PlayPrefs.
This choice allows you to utilize a variety of formats, including classes. 
It's a more maintainable and secure approach compared to PlayPrefs.
Feel free to clone the project, explore the code, and share your feedback.
